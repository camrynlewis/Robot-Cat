# Mr. Jellybot

Mr. Jellybot meows and his eyes turn green when you stroke his head. When the bird button is pushed, he begins to purr. The meow is created by a combination of frequencies that mimic the components of the classic sound for varying durations. I did some research and found that cats purr at a frequency of 22Hz, so while creepy, it is accurate.
